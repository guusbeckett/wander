    <Text>Right from the Molenstraat you will see the Library, designed by architect Herman Hertzberger. Because the Molenstraat (Millstreet) is quite narrow, the architect has created space by adding sloping walls to the library.

The place is still shown in the asphalt with cobblestones, the asphalt road is the site of the old moat.</Text>
